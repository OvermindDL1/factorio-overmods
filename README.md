# Factorio overmods

This mod is a catch all to add a variety of useful things to Factorio.

Currently it contains:

* Basic Modifier Researches, entirely configurable via the in-game GUI.
  * This are researches like Bot Batteries, Player run/craft speed, reach, etc...
* Burner Assembler that handles a single input and runs at 25% speed, enough to get 'some' automation going at the start to automate gears or whatever else is wanted.

TODO:

* Non-basic Modifier Researches
